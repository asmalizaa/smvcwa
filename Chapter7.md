# Handling Requests

## Identifying Views

Spring MVC defines the ViewResolver and View interfaces that let you render models in a browser without tying you to a specific view technology. ViewResolver provides a mapping between view names and actual views. View addresses the preparation of data before handing over to a specific view technology.

The following table provides more details on the ViewResolver hierarchy:

<table>
  <tr><th>ViewResolver</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AbstractCachingViewResolver</td>
    <td>Subclasses of AbstractCachingViewResolver cache view instances that they resolve. Caching improves performance of certain view technologies. You can turn off the cache by setting the cache property to false. Furthermore, if you must refresh a certain view at runtime (for example, when a FreeMarker template is modified), you can use the removeFromCache(String viewName, Locale loc) method.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>UrlBasedViewResolver</td>
    <td>Simple implementation of the ViewResolver interface that effects the direct resolution of logical view names to URLs without an explicit mapping definition. This is appropriate if your logical names match the names of your view resources in a straightforward manner, without the need for arbitrary mappings.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>InternalResourceViewResolver</td>
    <td>Convenient subclass of UrlBasedViewResolver that supports InternalResourceView (in effect, Servlets and JSPs) and subclasses such as JstlView. You can specify the view class for all views generated by this resolver by using setViewClass(..). See the UrlBasedViewResolver javadoc for details.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FreeMarkerViewResolver</td>
    <td>Convenient subclass of UrlBasedViewResolver that supports FreeMarkerView and custom subclasses of them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ContentNegotiatingViewResolver</td>
    <td>Implementation of the ViewResolver interface that resolves a view based on the request file name or Accept header.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BeanNameViewResolver</td>
    <td>Implementation of the ViewResolver interface that interprets a view name as a bean name in the current application context. This is a very flexible variant which allows for mixing and matching different view types based on distinct view names. Each such View can be defined as a bean e.g. in XML or in configuration classes.</td>
