# Validation

## Validating Form Input

Reference: (https://spring.io/guides/gs/validating-form-input)

You will build a simple Spring MVC application that takes user input and checks the input by using standard validation annotations. You will also see how to display the error message on the screen so that the user can re-enter input to make it be valid.
