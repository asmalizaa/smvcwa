# Data Binding

Reference: (https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/beans-beans.html#page-title)

Data binding is useful for binding user input to a target object where user input is a map with property paths as keys, following JavaBeans conventions. DataBinder is the main class that supports this, and it provides two ways to bind user input:

- Constructor binding - bind user input to a public data constructor, looking up constructor argument values in the user input.
- Property binding - bind user input to setters, matching keys from the user input to properties of the target object structure.

You can apply both constructor and property binding or only one.

## Constructor Binding

To use constructor binding:

1. Create a DataBinder with null as the target object.
2. Set targetType to the target class.
3. Call construct.

The target class should have a single public constructor or a single non-public constructor with arguments. If there are multiple constructors, then a default constructor if present is used.

By default, constructor parameter names are used to look up argument values, but you can configure a NameResolver. Spring MVC and WebFlux both rely to allow customizing the name of the value to bind through an @BindParam annotation on constructor parameters.

Type conversion is applied as needed to convert user input. If the constructor parameter is an object, it is constructed recursively in the same manner, but through a nested property path. That means constructor binding creates both the target object and any objects it contains.

Binding and conversion errors are reflected in the BindingResult of the DataBinder. If the target is created successfully, then target is set to the created instance after the call to construct.

## Property Binding with BeanWrapper

The org.springframework.beans package adheres to the JavaBeans standard.

One quite important class in the beans package is the BeanWrapper interface and its corresponding implementation (BeanWrapperImpl). 
- BeanWrapper offers functionality to set and get property values (individually or in bulk), get property descriptors, and query properties to determine if they are readable or writable.
- BeanWrapper offers support for nested properties, enabling the setting of properties on sub-properties to an unlimited depth.
- BeanWrapper also supports the ability to add standard JavaBeans PropertyChangeListeners and VetoableChangeListeners, without the need for supporting code in the target class.
- BeanWrapper provides support for setting indexed properties.
- BeanWrapper usually is not used by application code directly but is used by the DataBinder and the BeanFactory.

The way the BeanWrapper works is partly indicated by its name: it wraps a bean to perform actions on that bean, such as setting and retrieving properties.

## Setting and Getting Basic and Nested Properties

Setting and getting properties is done through the setPropertyValue and getPropertyValue overloaded method variants of BeanWrapper.

The following two example classes use the BeanWrapper to get and set properties:

```java
public class Company {

	private String name;
	private Employee managingDirector;

	public String getName() {
		return this.name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public Employee getManagingDirector() {
		return this.managingDirector;
	}

	public void setManagingDirector(Employee managingDirector) {
		this.managingDirector = managingDirector;
	}
}
```
```java
public class Employee {

	private String name;

	private float salary;

	public String getName() {
		return this.name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public float getSalary() {
		return salary;
	}

	public void setSalary(float salary) {
		this.salary = salary;
	}
}
```

The following code snippets show some examples of how to retrieve and manipulate some of the properties of instantiated Companys and Employees:

```java
BeanWrapper company = new BeanWrapperImpl(new Company());
// setting the company name..
company.setPropertyValue("name", "Some Company Inc.");
// ... can also be done like this:
PropertyValue value = new PropertyValue("name", "Some Company Inc.");
company.setPropertyValue(value);

// ok, let's create the director and tie it to the company:
BeanWrapper jim = new BeanWrapperImpl(new Employee());
jim.setPropertyValue("name", "Jim Stravinsky");
company.setPropertyValue("managingDirector", jim.getWrappedInstance());

// retrieving the salary of the managingDirector through the company
Float salary = (Float) company.getPropertyValue("managingDirector.salary");
```

## PropertyEditor's

Spring uses the concept of a PropertyEditor to effect the conversion between an Object and a String. 

It can be handy to represent properties in a different way than the object itself. For example, a Date can be represented in a human readable way (as the String: '2007-14-09'), while we can still convert the human readable form back to the original date (or, even better, convert any date entered in a human readable form back to Date objects). 

This behavior can be achieved by registering custom editors of type java.beans.PropertyEditor. Registering custom editors on a BeanWrapper or, alternatively, in a specific IoC container (as mentioned in the previous chapter), gives it the knowledge of how to convert properties to the desired type. 

A couple of examples where property editing is used in Spring:

- Setting properties on beans is done by using PropertyEditor implementations. When you use String as the value of a property of some bean that you declare in an XML file, Spring (if the setter of the corresponding property has a Class parameter) uses ClassEditor to try to resolve the parameter to a Class object.
- Parsing HTTP request parameters in Springâ€™s MVC framework is done by using all kinds of PropertyEditor implementations that you can manually bind in all subclasses of the CommandController.

Spring has a number of built-in PropertyEditor implementations to make life easy. They are all located in the org.springframework.beans.propertyeditors package. Most, (but not all, as indicated in the following table) are, by default, registered by BeanWrapperImpl. Where the property editor is configurable in some fashion, you can still register your own variant to override the default one.

The following Java source code for the referenced SomethingBeanInfo class associates a CustomNumberEditor with the age property of the Something class:

```java
public class SomethingBeanInfo extends SimpleBeanInfo {

	public PropertyDescriptor[] getPropertyDescriptors() {
		try {
			final PropertyEditor numberPE = new CustomNumberEditor(Integer.class, true);
			PropertyDescriptor ageDescriptor = new PropertyDescriptor("age", Something.class) {
				@Override
				public PropertyEditor createPropertyEditor(Object bean) {
					return numberPE;
				}
			};
			return new PropertyDescriptor[] { ageDescriptor };
		}
		catch (IntrospectionException ex) {
			throw new Error(ex.toString());
		}
	}
}
```
